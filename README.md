# Android Movie App

This Android Movie App has been initially implemented based on AwsRh youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk1RriXpf90).

We used his base concept to learn and use some layouts. Then we added some new functionalities as Registration, Login, Translate, Favorite Movie, etc.

We let the app dynamic using the The Movie Database API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

We are using these libraries/technologies:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Butter Knife** - To bind field and method for Android views.   
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Glide** - To load images on the views.
